# Penguins-Flipper-Length-Prediction-NumPy-only-
The goal of this project is to predict penguins' flipper length based on their body mass using a Linear Regression model implemented entirely from scratch with NumPy. This exercise demonstrates the process of building a machine learning model without relying on high-level libraries.
